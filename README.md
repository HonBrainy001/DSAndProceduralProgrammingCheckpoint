PROBLEM STATEMENT 1
Find the sum of distinct numbers from two sets using array.
PSEUDOCODE
1.	Input: Input two sets of arrays, arr A and arr B
2.	Initialize sum: Initialize a variable sum to 0
3.	Compare each elements of arr A with arr B and vice versa using arr.forEach function
4.	While this check if the elements is present in the other array, if not it adds the element to the sum.
5.	The final result represents the sum of the distinct elements from both arrays.
   
PROBLEM STATEMENT 2
Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 where v1 and v2 are vectors of IR.
